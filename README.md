# Docker_NTN
In this project, we try to solve many exercises to building a 5G network.
1. Build 5G core, RAN, and UE using Dockerfile. Specifically, we used open sources such as free5gc and UERANSIM to build 5g core and RAN/UE, respectively. Each NF in free5gc, RAN, and UE are built as a separeate docker container.
2. Using Bashscript to update the IP address of each NF in free5gc, RAN, and UE automatically.
